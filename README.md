# ðŸ¥­ SSD Mango Detection Pipeline

This project implements a real-time **object detection pipeline** using a pre-trained **Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD)** model to detect mangoes in images. It is built with OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and NumPy for high-performance image processing and model inference.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

- Loads a pre-trained SSD model for mango detection
- Processes input images or video streams
- Detects mango objects and visualizes bounding boxes with confidence scores
- Applies non-maximum suppression (NMS) to filter redundant detections
- Supports batch processing and performance metrics
